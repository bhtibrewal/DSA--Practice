In this problem, you are asked to implement an enhanced debounce() which accepts third parameter, option: {leading: boolean, trailing: boolean}

leading: whether to invoke right away
trailing: whether to invoke after the delay.
basic debounce() is the default case with {leading: false, trailing: true}.

for the previous example of debouncing by 3 dashes

─A─B─C─ ─D─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ E─ ─F─G

with {leading: false, trailing: true}, we get as below

─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─D─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ G

with {leading: true, trailing: true}:

─A─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─D─ ─ ─E─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─G

with {leading: true, trailing: false}

─A─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─E

with {leading: false, trailing: false}, of course, nothing happens.
